# Distributed Ledger-Based Vulnerability Database

The aim of this project is to create distributed database that enable all users to add vulnerabilities under certain criteria when a vulnerability comes out. The cur-rent centralized database which is named National Vulnerability
Database (NVD) is insufficient to include all vulnerabilities and store securely providing all security requirements. There are also many vulnerability database platforms such as exploit-db, OSVDB. As a result, Distributed Ledger based vulnerability database will provide more secure,
accessible convenient and aggregated database for all interested parties about information security.

These are some of the advantages that differentiate this project from the current
databases:

* Decentralization : Eliminating the need for central authority.
* Utilisable : Providing rights for benefits of every user
* Aggregation : Collecting all vulnerabilities on a single platform

## Introduction

The distributed ledger Database Structure is based on several nodes on a
network where each saves a copy of the ledger and have updated data. Each
node can construct new transactions and the nodes validates by the consensus
algorithm. When the validation of transaction is completed, the ledger updates
itself and all nodes have the collected data. The security is accomplished by
strong hashing algorithms and cryptographic keys.
In this study, I created the distributed ledger based web vulnerability
database platform. To eliminate security problems and to provide
collective data, this plat-form provide that users can easily access all VDB
data, add a new vulnerability and be also miner in the system.
Guided tour puzzle protocol is used to perform proof of work algorithm. It
is based on puzzle solving correctly in a sequential order. The new
submits from the client are added the blocks and after mining process,
vulnerabilities are validated and added to the tree that is classified
according to OWASP top Ten web vulnerability document.

## Guided Tour Puzzle Protocol
To perform the mining process, which is necessary for the vulnerabilities to
be validated and added to the distributed ledger, I used the Guided Tour
Puzzle Protocol, a network bound proof of work mechanism. Guided Tour
Puzzle Protocol is a cryptographic protocol that aims to overcome the
computation of puzzle that is created by the server. The clients are required
to complete multiple roud trips in a sequential order.

* Initial server request
* Puzzle solving
* Puzzle verification

## Methodology
I used Python programming language to implement this project. To implement an
interface, I used Flask web framework and created web APIs.

## Web APIs

First, the client adds a new vulnerability by filling the required data on the submit tab. Until the new
mining process starts, new vulnerabilities are added to a single block with an index number. After
submission process, the new vulnerability is added to submit list of the distributed ledger. When the
mining process request comes from the miner, guided tour puzzle protocol computes the proof and try
to mine the last block in the block list of the ledger.

## Data Structure and Classification

After mining process, the vulnerabilities will be added to tree
OWASP Top Ten vulnerability classifications. The tree structure is as
follows:
A1 : Injection
A2 : Broken Authentication
A3 : Sensitive Data Exposure
A4 : XML External Entities
A5 : Broken Access Control
A6 : Security Misconfiguration
A7 : XSS
A8 : Insecure Deserialization
A9 : Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
A10: Insufficient Logging & Monitoring
vuln_tree = { "A0": [ ], "A1" : [ ] , "A2": [ ], "A3": [ ] , "A4" : [ ], "A5": [ ],
"A6": [ ], "A7" : [ ] , "A8": [ ], "A9": [ ] , "A10": [ ] }

## Conclusion
In this study, I created the distributed ledger based web vulnerability
database platform. To eliminate security problems and to provide

## FutureWork

This study is only created for web application vulnerabilities. The project
can be extended by adding different types of vulnerability to make a more
comprehensive database. The new required standards can be added for
the submission process of the client. The search mechanism may be
faster with a strong search algorithm. Rewarding and incentive
mechanism can be developed and enhanced for the clients.
